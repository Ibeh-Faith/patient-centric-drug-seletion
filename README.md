# patient-centric-drug-seletion

Step into the realm of healthcare innovation, the patient-centric drug selector, in our project, "Patient-Centric Drug Selection using Machine Learning." This project offers an immersive journey into data analysis, model building, and evaluation using machine learning techniques to revolutionize patient care through accurate drug predictions.
The primary objective of this project is to leverage machine learning to predict the most suitable medication for patients based on vital factors like age, sex, blood pressure, and other critical attributes. Through hands-on experience in handling medical data and applying machine learning concepts, we will explore the realms of healthcare analytics and its potential to optimize patient-centric drug selection.

The dataset encompasses crucial patient attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure levels (BP), cholesterol levels, and the sodium-to-potassium ratio. Our focus lies in utilizing these features to predict the ideal drug type for patients, thereby enabling personalized and effective medical treatment decisions.

This venture isn't solely about predicting drug types; it's a transformative journey that seeks to enhance patient outcomes by offering tailored and precise drug predictions. The dataset provides an exceptional opportunity to delve into healthcare-focused machine learning techniques, aiming to revolutionize the delivery of healthcare services.
